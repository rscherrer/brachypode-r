## mutational-rescue

This is an analysis to test our intuition that the whole landscape deterioration scenario invariably leads to extinction because it shifts the stress-tolerant evolutionary equilibrium away from the evolving population in phenotype space. The population is not trapped in a subspace of the adaptive landscape like in the shrub cover shrinkage scenario, but rather, it becomes dangerously close to the extinction boundary, which goes up as the landscape deteriorates. Whether the stress-tolerant equilibrium can be reached before the population goes extinct determines its survival, and this becomes harder as the unfacilitated patches also deteriorate. We hypothesized that if this is true, and extinction is predicted by the distance to the next equilibrium in phenotype space, then reducing the pace of deterioration of unfacilitated patches relative to facilitated patches (1) should increase survival (as it is almost guaranteed in its most extreme form - the stress increase scenario), and (2) should require lower mutation rates to rescue the population from extinction (conversely higher mutation rates should be needed to jump to safety when the pace of deterioration of unfacilitated patches is high).
