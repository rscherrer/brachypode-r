## mutual-invasibility

Here we perform a series of analyses of the coexistence, or mutual invasibility, of two morphs across trait and parameter space. We analyze things like whether there are pairs of trait values that can coexist, which trait values can, and where those pairs of trait values evolve towards in trait space (e.g. whether a system with two morphs remains polymorphic). Note that in this anaylsis we make used of faster C++ code.
