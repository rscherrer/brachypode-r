List of things I decided **not to do** for this project (at least for now):

* **Make the adaptive dynamics code its own package**. This will happen after I submit my thesis.

* **Only load the functions needed for a given analysis**. By default all the R scripts in `functions/` are loaded. That's overkill and messy, but that's okay.

* **Move the description of the data** from their respective analyses to the data themselves (especially for the climate change experiment)
